Project description
-------------------------

In this project, you will build a shopping cart where you can add a variety of fruits and a number of quantities. You can add, remove, and checkout your shopping cart and there is even a limited number of fruits you can purchase at a time to better simulate a real shop. In this project a few skills are learned: mostly associative arrays and 2d arrays.

Try it out!
